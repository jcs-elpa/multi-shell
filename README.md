# multi-shell
> Managing multiple shell buffers.

[![CI](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/multi-shell/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/multi-shell/actions/workflows/test.yml)

Simple and completely compatible to Emacs' built-in `shell` implementation.
This also works with `eshell`.

## ‚ùì Differences from other alternatives

* [mutli-term](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MultiTerm)
  - Doesn't work in Windows.

## üîß Usage

`multi-shell` provides the following interactive functions

* `multi-shell` - Create a new shell buffer.
* `multi-shell-select` - Switch to shell buffer.
* `multi-shell-next` - Switch to next shell buffer.
* `multi-shell-prev` - Switch to previous shell buffer.
* `multi-shell-kill` - Kill the current shell buffer.
* `multi-shell-kill-all` - Kill all shell buffers.

## üß™ Customization

Add these two lines in your configuration file if you do use any package
management tool. (Like, [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package))

```el
(require 'multi-shell)
(setq multi-shell-prefer-shell-type 'shell)  ; Also accept `eshell`.
```

If you are using [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package)
for package management.

```el
(use-package multi-shell
  :init
  (setq multi-shell-prefer-shell-type 'shell))  ; Also accept `eshell`.
```
